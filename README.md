### About me

 Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marianela.

A year and a half ago, I made a huge change in my life and I moved from my accountant degree to be a junior developer in the making. I'm currently working as a backend developer.

This account is still in the making so you can find exercises and assignments made while I was learning on a Bootcamp and some contributions to work-related projects.

As I still have a lot to learn I'm always looking for courses, workshops, and opportunities to learn from fellow developers.

I try to be involved in the dev community so I go to meetups and I'm part of several women dev communities.

### Languages and contributions

The majority of my contributions are done on my work's repositories which are private.
